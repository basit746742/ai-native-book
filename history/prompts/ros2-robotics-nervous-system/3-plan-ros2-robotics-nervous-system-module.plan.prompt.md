## Prompt

```text

```

## Response snapshot

Completed the planning phase for the ROS 2 Robotics Nervous System educational module. Created implementation plan, research document, data model, quickstart guide, and API contracts. The plan outlines a Docusaurus-based educational module covering ROS 2 basics, AI-to-robot control, and URDF modeling for AI/Software Engineering students.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete planning artifacts created for ROS 2 educational module
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for planning phase
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, and API contracts
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to proceed with task creation (/sp.tasks) or implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Planning phase successfully completed with all required artifacts

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
