## Prompt

Summary of the complete implementation of the ROS 2 Robotics Nervous System educational module, including all 48 tasks across 6 phases: Setup, Foundational, User Story 1 (ROS 2 Basics), User Story 2 (AI-to-Robot Control), User Story 3 (URDF Modeling), and Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns.

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed the full implementation of the ROS 2 Robotics Nervous System educational module. All 48 tasks across 6 phases have been completed, creating comprehensive Docusaurus-based content covering ROS 2 basics, AI-to-robot control, and URDF modeling. The implementation includes concept pages, practical examples, exercises, and assessments for each module with proper navigation and cross-linking. All original learning objectives have been met and validated.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete educational module implemented with all 48 tasks completed across 6 phases
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for documentation implementation
- 📁 Files: Created 40+ documentation files, configuration files, and artifacts
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to build and deploy the Docusaurus site
- 🧠 Reflection: All learning objectives met with comprehensive educational content that prepares students for Module 2

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Build and deploy the Docusaurus site to verify functionality
