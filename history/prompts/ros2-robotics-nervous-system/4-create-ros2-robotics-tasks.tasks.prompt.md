## Prompt

```text

```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive task list for the ROS 2 Robotics Nervous System educational module. Tasks are organized in phases: Setup (T001-T004), Foundational (T005-T009), User Story 1 - ROS 2 Communication Fundamentals (T010-T018), User Story 2 - AI-to-Robot Control Integration (T019-T028), User Story 3 - Humanoid Robot Modeling with URDF (T029-T039), and Polish phase (T040-T048). The tasks follow the required format with checkboxes, IDs, parallel markers [P], and story labels [US1, US2, US3].

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task list created for ROS 2 educational module implementation
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for task creation
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with 48 structured tasks organized by user stories
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to proceed with implementation (/sp.implement) or review
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks properly organized by user story priority with clear dependencies

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
