# ROS 2 Robotics Nervous System - Modules Overview

Welcome to the comprehensive educational module on ROS 2 as the core middleware for humanoid robot communication and control. This module is designed for AI and Software Engineering students with basic Python knowledge, providing a progressive learning path through the essential concepts of ROS 2.

## Learning Path

This educational module is organized into three progressive learning units that build upon each other:

### [ROS 2 Basics: Nodes, Topics, Services](./ros2-basics/introduction)
- **Focus**: ROS 2 architecture and communication model
- **Success**: You understand data flow and when to use topics vs services
- **Excludes**: Installation, DDS internals, advanced QoS

Start here to understand the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 communication architecture. You'll learn about nodes, topics, and services - the building blocks of all ROS 2 systems.

### [AI-to-Robot Control with rclpy](./ai-robot-control/perception)
- **Focus**: Connecting Python AI agents to ROS 2 nodes
- **Success**: You can explain perception → decision → action via ROS 2
- **Excludes**: RL systems, hardware drivers, optimization

Once you understand basic communication, learn how to connect your Python-based AI algorithms to ROS 2 systems. This section covers the perception → decision → action flow that characterizes intelligent robotic systems.

### [Humanoid Modeling with URDF](./urdf-modeling/introduction)
- **Focus**: Links, joints, kinematic chains, ROS 2 integration
- **Success**: You can conceptually model a humanoid structure
- **Excludes**: CAD design, advanced dynamics

Finally, learn how to model humanoid robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) and understand how these models integrate with ROS 2 for simulation and control purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of object-oriented programming concepts
- Familiarity with command-line tools

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will be able to:
1. Explain the ROS 2 communication architecture and distinguish between topics and services
2. Connect Python AI agents to ROS 2 nodes using rclpy
3. Understand the perception → decision → action flow in robotics
4. Model humanoid robots using URDF and integrate with ROS 2
5. Apply appropriate communication patterns to different robotic scenarios

## Next Steps

After completing this module, you'll be ready for Module 2 on simulation and digital twins, where you'll apply these concepts in practical simulation environments.
