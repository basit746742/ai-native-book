# ROS 2 Robotics Nervous System

Welcome to the educational module on ROS 2 as the core middleware for humanoid robot communication and control. This module is designed for AI and Software Engineering students with basic Python knowledge.

## Overview

This module covers three main areas:
1. **ROS 2 Basics**: Understanding nodes, topics, and services
2. **AI-to-Robot Control**: Connecting Python AI agents to ROS 2 nodes
3. **Humanoid Modeling**: Using URDF for robot structure and kinematics

Each section builds upon the previous one, creating a comprehensive understanding of ROS 2 in robotics applications.
